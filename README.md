üè† Home Energy Management System (HEMS) with PV and ESS
This project models a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that optimally schedules the operation of an Energy Storage System (ESS) in the presence of Photovoltaic (PV) generation and residential electrical loads. The objective is to minimize the total electricity bill while efficiently managing energy flow within the household.

Key components:

Photovoltaic (PV) System: Generates renewable energy to meet household demand or charge the ESS.

Energy Storage System (ESS): Stores excess solar energy or low-cost grid energy for later use.

Load Profile: Represents household consumption patterns over a defined time horizon.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
Formulation of the energy scheduling problem as an optimization model (e.g., MILP or LP)

Cost-minimization strategy considering:

Time-of-use electricity pricing

ESS charging/discharging efficiency

PV generation forecast

Load demand forecast

Constraints on:

ESS state of charge (SOC)

Power flow limits

Grid import/export (if applicable)

üìà Outcomes
Reduced electricity bills through optimized ESS scheduling

Better utilization of renewable energy

Insights into the economic value of battery storage in smart homes
